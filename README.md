  FB --> CAM[Camera]
  FB --> UI[Web UI]
```

- **Data Ingestion:** Integrates with various launch monitors to capture essential ball and club metrics (e.g., speed, spin, trajectory).

- **Data Processing:** Transforms and modifies the raw shot data to ensure it meets the requirements for accurate simulation.

- **Data Routing to Simulation Software:** Passes the processed information to compatible golf simulation software for real-time visual feedback.

- **Media Capture:** Interfaces with supported cameras (such as GoPro models) to record swing videos for playback and analysis.

- **Data Logging:** Records raw and modified shot data into a CSV file, preserving detailed shot history for further analysis.

- **Web-Based User Interface:** Provides a comprehensive web UI for configuration, monitoring, and displaying real-time statistics and logs.



## üéõ Features

Fairway Bridge was created to overcome real-world challenges in integrating launch monitor hardware and to bypass the limitations of traditional connectivity methods. Acting as a reliable integration layer, it meets the following needs:

- **Network-Based Launch Monitor Connectivity:**  
  Connect Launch Monitors to Simulators over a network instead of relying on Bluetooth, enabling a more flexible and dependable setup.


- **Use of Alternative Golf Balls:**  
  Leverage almostGOLF balls with select launch monitors for a quieter experience, while still capturing accurate data.


- **Ability to Fine-Tune Data:**  
  Adjust real-time modifiers that influence shot data, allowing you to modify ball speed, spin, and other parameters. This feature is especially useful for simulating different conditions or correcting data discrepancies.


- **Flexible Simulator Configurations:**  
  Seamlessly switch between different simulator setups, making the application adaptable to a variety of simulation environments and user needs.


- **Comprehensive Data Logging:**  
  Capture and store both raw and adjusted shot data in a CSV file, facilitating detailed analysis and performance tracking over time.


- **Cost-Effective Media Integration:**  
  Leverage affordable, off-the-shelf cameras to automate swing video recording, providing valuable playback and analysis capabilities.


- **Enhanced Display and Control:**  
  Access real-time statistics, configuration settings, and monitoring features through a user-friendly web interface that supports multiple devices, including monitors and touchscreens.



## üíæ Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Go:** Version 1.23 or later (visit [golang.org](https://golang.org/doc/install) for installation instructions).
- **Git:** For cloning the repository.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/401unauthorized/fairway-bridge.git
   cd fairway-bridge
   ```

2. **Build the Application:**
   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. **Prepare the Environment:**
    - Ensure your system has access to your required hardware (launch monitor, simulator, camera).
    - Create necessary directories (e.g., for logs and video files) if not already present.



## üîå How to Run the Application

### Shot Emulation
You can test the system without needing any physical hardware by running the application in virtual mode. For example:

```bash
fairway-bridge -launch-monitor=virtual -simulator=virtual -camera=virtual
```

When you run this command, the application will generate a `fairway-bridge.log` file, which you can check to verify that everything is working as expected. 

The program will prompt you in the terminal to enter a distance in yards. Based on your input, it uses a **simple algorithm to emulate ball and club data** to match that distance and sends the resulting data to the virtual simulator.

Alternatively, you can run:

```bash
fairway-bridge -launch-monitor=virtual -simulator=GSPRO -camera=virtual
```

This command allows you to send shots to an actual simulator (GSPro) using the same basic yards-to-shot data algorithm. This setup provides a convenient way to test your simulator software without needing a real launch monitor‚Äîand it can even be a fun way to play around when you're bored.

### Capture Real Shots

1. **Set Up Hardware:**  
   Ensure that your launch monitor, simulator, and (if applicable) camera are connected and configured.


2. **Build and Configure:**  
   Follow the [Installation](#installation) steps and adjust CLI parameters as needed for your setup.


3. **Launch the Application:**
   Run the compiled binary with your configuration flags. The application will:
    - Parse and display configuration settings.
    - Start the API server for the web interface.
    - Initiate camera capture (if enabled).
    - Provide connectivity for the launch monitor and simulator.
    - Log system activity and display a message indicating that servers are running.


4. **Access the Web Interface:**  
   Open your web browser and navigate to the address specified by the `-http-ip` and `-http-port` flags (e.g., [http://127.0.0.1:2484/settings](http://127.0.0.1:2484/settings)).


5. **Connect Launch Monitor**  
   **Note:** To connect your Garmin R10, open the Garmin Golf app and select **E6 Connect** in the "Other Simulators" section. Then, set the IP address and port to match the values you configured in Fairway Bridge via the CLI.


6. **Terminate the Application:**  
   Press **Ctrl+C** to safely shut down the system. The application ensures proper shutdown procedures for all connected hardware.



## ‚õ≥Ô∏è Supported Hardware and Simulators

### Launch Monitors

Fairway Bridge supports multiple launch monitor systems. The launch monitor is specified via the `-launch-monitor` flag. Example systems include:
- R10
